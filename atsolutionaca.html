                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Our team of skilled web developers has years of experience creating academic websites for primary schools. We work closely with our clients to understand their specific needs and goals, and then we design and develop a website that meets those requirements.
                        If you need a simple, informative website that provides basic information about your school, we can help. We use the latest web development technologies and frameworks to create websites that are fast, reliable, and secure.

                    <div>
                        We've developed strategies to focus on the user experience (UX) of the website. This means designing the website in a way that is intuitive and easy to use for parents, teachers, and other stakeholders. We do this by using clear navigation, consistent branding, and engaging visuals that help users quickly find the information they need.

                    <div>
                        And also strategies to make the website accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This means designing the website with accessibility features such as alt tags for images, clear and readable fonts, and support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

            <div class="info2">
                <p>In addition to the strategies and features we mentioned in our previous blog post, there are several other functionalities that can be included in an academic website for primary schools to make it more informative and engaging for users. <br> <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i> </p>

                    <div>
                        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
                        One such functionality is a gallery section, where the school can showcase photos and videos of various events, activities, and achievements. This not only helps to showcase the school's culture and values, but also provides parents and students with a glimpse into the daily life of the school.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
                        Another important functionality is the ability to display the price lists of books and stationary for each class, as well as the school fees for each level. This can help parents to easily find and compare the costs of various items and services, and ensure that they are fully informed about the financial aspects of their child's education.
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        In addition to these functionalities, an academic website can also include a section with information about the school's staff, including their names, photos, and contact details. This can help parents and students to easily get in touch with teachers and staff members when needed, and can also help to build a sense of community and connection within the school.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
                        Other functionalities that may be relevant for an academic website for primary schools include a news and events section, where the school can post updates and information about upcoming events and activities, as well as a resources section, where parents and students can access important documents and information such as school policies, forms, and schedules.
